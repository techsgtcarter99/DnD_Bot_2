----Welcome to my DnD Bot-----
----This README.md file is under construction-----

  This bot was originally going to be a project for users to create characters and use them in game, however it turned into a tool for the Dungeon Masters
it uses the randomint from random library for the dice rolling and of course the discord library to connect to the platform Discord; the dice rolling will 
work for both combat (no bonuses at this time) and to determine treasure.  It also has PDF files fornthe various monsters to see and display if the DM wishes
too just by typing in the monster's name, it will display all pages pertinent to that monster.

  CURRENTLY: Not working on this bot to finish two projects, but will return to add a few more functions in 2022!
